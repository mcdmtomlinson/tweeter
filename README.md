# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone.

This repository is the starter code for the project: Students will fork and clone this repository, then build upon it to practice their HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery and AJAX front-end skills, and their Node, Express back-end skills.

## Usage

1. To create a new tweet use each of the toggle buttons. There is one on the navigation bar and other that appears when you scroll down. 
2. After clicking a toggle button, you will be presented with a section to compose a new tweet, up to 140 characters.
3. Ensure your tweet is more than 0 characters and less than 140 characters to avoid receiving an error.
